##Seizure Localization Research

I worked in the Neuromedical Control Systems Lab at Johns Hopkins under Dr. Sridevi Sarma to help develop an algorithm for seizure localization in medically refractory epilepsy patients.

Specifically I focused on processing raw patient EEG data into meaningful signals that can be used to localize the point of generation of the seizures. Algorithms were written in MATLAB and select ones are included here.
